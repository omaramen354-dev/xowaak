/**
 * Headline reveal that works in every locale, including Arabic.
 *
 * Why not Shuffle: it splits text into per-CHARACTER spans, which severs
 * Arabic letter joining (كتابة -> ك ت ا ب ة). Our workaround was to disable
 * the effect under RTL entirely, so the Arabic hero had no animation at all.
 *
 * This splits on WORDS instead. Word boundaries are safe in every script —
 * Arabic letters inside a word stay joined — so all 7 locales get the same
 * treatment and no branch is needed.
 *
 * Each word rises, unblurs and settles with a slight overshoot, staggered
 * left-to-right (or right-to-left, following the reading direction).
